# I lost my brew?
- If you made any edits with an account, you can go to that account's page
- Homebrewery stores the last handful of brews you've viewed or edited under the recent brews tab
- Check your browser history for the edit link
- If all of that fails, find the share link, open the source and copy it into a new brew.
